# Project description #
The program generates a random word and the user has to guess it. Initially, all the letters of the word are unknown. A hangman with a noose is also drawn. The user proposes a letter that could be in the word.
# Requirements #
1. If such a letter is in the word, the program places the letter as many times as it appears in the word.
2. If such a letter is not in the word, a circle is added to the noose, depicting a head. The user continues to guess letters until he guesses the whole word. 
For each unsuccessful attempt, another part of the hangman's body is added (usually there are 6 of them: head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs).
3. Categories and hints for words have been added.
4. A game mode with 8 parts instead of 6 has been added.
